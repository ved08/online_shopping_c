# PPS Course Based Project.
# Online Shopping in C
This project presents the implementation of a simple online shopping system using the C programming language. The system incorporates fundamental concepts of programming, including the use of structs and arrays, to create a menu-driven interface for users to add items to a virtual shopping cart and proceed to checkout.

The program defines a global array of items, each represented by a structure containing information such as item name, quantity, and price. 
There are 2 main functions in the program: 
1) addToCart(): This function adds items to the shopping cart
2) checkout(): This function displays all the available items in the cart so that user can proceed with it

When users checks out, the program displays the items present in the cart neatly by formatting the strings
